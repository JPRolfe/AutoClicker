# AutoClicker

Designed an Autoclicker for Runescape to help me AFK train my combat skills!

Hopefully the GUI is intuitive enough to help you autoclick on your first try.

The Lower limit Value and Upper Limit Value is the interval wait time between each click. The Seconds Option is not currently working (Work in Progress) hence the AutoClicker only works for milliseconds at the moment.

Press & Release Click delay is the wait time between each click (Currently Disabled - Work in Progress)

Clicks Remaining is also disabled and will be implemented in future updates.

WORKING: CLICK INTERVAL TIME, SET AREA, SET DELAY (FINITE CLICKING & ENDLESS), SET KEYBIND.

NOT WORKING: PRESS & RELEASE CLICK DELAY, CLICKS REMAINING.
